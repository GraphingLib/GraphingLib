Renamed Histogram.number_of_bins
--------------------------------
Renamed parameter "number_of_bins" to "bins" in Histogram class for consistency and clarity since this parameter can be used to specify bin edges as well as the number of bins.

Improved Fits fitting range
---------------------------
Modified Fits classes to choose their fitting range based on the minimum and maximum x-values of the provided data instead of the first and last points.

Improved Histogram.__init__ and Heatmap._plot_element
-----------------------------------------------------
Cleaned these methods by removing redundant code and improving readability.

Renamed Point.color to face_color
---------------------------------
Renamed the "color" parameter in the Point class to "face_color" for consistency with the Scatter class.

Transformed Heatmap._xy_range to a property
-------------------------------------------
_xy_range is now a property to keep it updated if the axis ranges are modified after the Heatmap's creation.

Filling Curve between bounds now uses facecolor
-----------------------------------------------
Modified Curve._plot_element so it uses facecolor instead of color when filling between bounds to remove the solid contour.
